03/10/2013 Build 2.1.2
======================

---
NEW
---

	General
	=======

	- Add plugin version info in the plugin's admin page.

	- Added the Magento base path to be displayed in the admin under Plugin's version.

	- All plugin's file are now under the salesperson directory in the relevant locations.

	- Added "docs/files.txt" which list all of the Celebros Salesperson plugin folders/files location


	Search
	======

	- Added URL masking option (changing the plugin's front name):
		It is possible to change the URL so that it will change for example:

		From:	http://<domain>//salesperson/result/index/?q=Apparel

		To: 	http://<domain>//search/result/index/?q=Apparel

		- You cannot  change "salesperson" to "catalogsearch" as it is reserved for Magento's search.
		- Frontname can be changed only in the default scope for all store views that are connected to our search.

	- Added support for nav2search in Magento >= 1.13

        * <=1.13 Regular method (URL rewrite)
        * >=1.13 Catching event "catalog_controller_category_init_after" and there transferring the call to ResultController's index action.

	- Added support for nav2search blacklisting:
        1) Enable nav2search- This adds a new attribute to the categories. In "Catalog/Categories/Manage Categories" one can see now "Salesperson- Use category in nav2search"

		   When enabling nav2search for the first time it sets this value to "Yes" for all categories.

        2) One can change this value as wanted.

		3) After finishing setting this value for the categories there is a need to re-index the "Catalog URL rewrites" or go to our plugin's admin (where nav2search is already enabled from step 1) and press save.


	Export
	======
	
	- Exporting additional table "catalog_product_relation" for grouped and bundled products relations

	- Added an options in our export settings in Magento admin to specify extra tables to be exported.

	- Exporting now also the following tables:
	    - “salesperson_mapping”
	    - “review_entity_summary”


----------------
IMPROVED/CHANGED
----------------

	General
	=======

	- "Celebros.log" will be truncated if size >=2MB.


	Export
	======

	- Default export path changed to "/var/salesperson/export"

	- Images and thumbnails: If there is no image and also no placeholder for a product a message is being displayed (if running manual export) and the image/thumbnail link is empty.


	Search
	======

	- In search results list, product's image and URL are being taken from Magento now instead of from the XML

	- Redirect to product page on 1 result is taking the product's URL from Magento now instead of  from the XML.


---
FIX
---

	General
	=======

	- Removed PHP short tags usage.

	Export
	======

	- Products without categories were not exported. "categoryless_products.txt" is being exported now. Should be taken nto consideration by the transformation.
	
	- File name of exported table to not include the table prefix (if any)

	- Changed "Data_history.txt" to "Data_History.txt" as the DFM (new V8 CS) is case sensitive 

	- Update export to support extracting attributes info for products without a category.

	- Some customers are using a cloud service for the images (like rackcdn.com). Changed our code to take the media URL from Magento for the image URL and not from the original image URL.

	- Fix for some places in code that don't get the table names from Magento. Caused a problem when the customer used a prefix when installing Magento

	- Column names in “source_products.txt” and “categoryless_products.txt” are being taken from “Salesperson Mapping” if exist.


	Search
	======

	- Fix clear selected filter(s). There was a prag_replace that did anything but corrupt in some situations the search handle.

	- Grouped product price returns the minimal price.


	Analytics
	=========

	-  Product ANLX will use SKU instead of ID


======================

======================

-----
 New
-----

- Changes in salesperson mapping !!!:
	id -> mag_id
	sku -> sku

- What is known as large export is the default export now!. Integrators should use the MagentoTransformer tansformation.

- Zip file name of both the export (Default:products.txt) and the orders history (Exported if either crosssell/upsell or both are enabled) (default: Data_history.zip) can be configured for each store view in the plugin's admin.

- One can determin per store view in the admin if campaigns are active (Image, flash and redirect campaigns).

- New default parameters are set automatically when the plugin is installed:
	* General Settings/Port: 6035
	* Result Display Settings/Page Layout: 2 columns with left bar
	* Export Data Format Settings/Absolute Path is now automatically populated to 	 	 <magentopath>/var/export upon installing the plugin.

- Manual export and cron scheduling can only be run now when user is logged in to the Magento admin.

- Filter improvement: Selected filters are being displayed with their question name.     
  
  Example: Color / Black

  
----------
 Improved
----------

- Crosssel and upsell method change: We now overwrite class instead of layout changes

- Better display and logging for the export process.

- Memory usage when doing an export is greatly reduced.

- nav2search:

	Changes to the URL rewrite logic:

	The way that nav2search works is that when enabled for a specific store view it indexes the URL rewrite table and then when export is being run URL rewrite is being re-indexed  again for relevant store views.

	Between the time, that the client makes changes to the categories and the time of the export, the nav2search is not up to date.

	The major thing is that if the client/Magento performs a re-index of the URL rewrite table, than nav2search is not active until the next export.

	I changed this behavior now as follows:

	When enabling nav2search for a store view, the URL rewrite table is being re-indexed.

	Now anytime that a URL rewrite re-index is being done (Either manually or by Magento) our plugin detects it and performs our indexing for all relevant (where nav2search is active) store views.

	We are also still re-indexing the URL rewrite when doing an export because if the customer makes changes to the categories, this doesn’t necessarily triggers a Magento re-index. So if the export will run before the next automatic re-index this will shorten the time for updating the nav2search with changes to the categories.

	If nav2search is enabled for a store view then perform url rewrite on each admin save (This will update the url rewrite with any changes that might have been done and auto re-index didn't run yet).


	Our indexing process writes to a log file celebros.log under var/log. The following is an example of its output:

	2013-06-12T11:19:19+00:00 DEBUG (7): Salesperson- Checking need for reindexing of URL rewrite for store: English, ID:1
	2013-06-12T11:19:22+00:00 DEBUG (7): Salesperson- Reindexed URL rewrite for store: English, ID:1. Total Time: 3 sec.
	2013-06-12T11:19:22+00:00 DEBUG (7): Salesperson- Checking need for reindexing of URL rewrite for store: German, ID:2
	2013-06-12T11:19:25+00:00 DEBUG (7): Salesperson- Reindexed URL rewrite for store: German, ID:2. Total Time: 2.7 sec.
	2013-06-12T11:19:25+00:00 DEBUG (7): Salesperson- Checking need for reindexing of URL rewrite for store: French, ID:3
	2013-06-12T11:19:25+00:00 DEBUG (7): Salesperson- Checking need for reindexing of URL rewrite for store: Private Sales View, ID:4

- Sort by: Allows now for using the same XML field twice (For asc and desc).


-------
 Fixed
-------

- Fixed sort by display bug when performing a new search:
	When a new search is being performed then sort is the default sort (Previously sort was the defualt one, but the display showed the previously selected one (If changed))
    
- Fixed code so that product review count returns correct results

- The template in the list view is calling a function getProductUrl which we don't have in our Product.php model. Added the function

- Only manual export (GUI run) will echo to the screen. CRON won't (Prevents errors in some configurations where echoing from CLI causes issues)

- nav2search:
	* Fix for when there is only one store.
	* Fix for case where parent category is disabled.
